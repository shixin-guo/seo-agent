# SEO Agent

> SEO Agent is a comprehensive AI-powered SEO automation tool designed to streamline and enhance search engine optimization workflows. It serves SEO professionals, content marketers, digital agencies, and website owners by providing intelligent analysis and recommendations across four core SEO domains: keyword research, content optimization, technical site auditing, and backlink analysis.
